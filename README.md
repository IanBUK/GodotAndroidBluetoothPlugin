# Godot Android Bluetooth Plugin

This is the Android Studio project that implements all the logic to use Bluetooth LTE from Godot. Checkout the [Godot demo](https://github.com/pablojimenezmateo/GodotAndroidBluetoothDemo) to see a working example.

## Software versions

This versions have been tested:

* Android Studio: Bumblebee 2021.1.1 Patch 1
* Godot: 3.4.4
* Android: 11

## Initialize GodotBluetooth
To use the module functions on your scripts, start the module as follows: 

```GDScript

var bluetooth

func _ready():
	if Engine.has_singleton("GodotBluetooth344"):
		GodotBluetooth344 = Engine.get_singleton("GodotBluetooth344")
```

```GDScript
GodotBluetooth344.connect("_on_characteristic_found", self, "_on_characteristic_found")
```

This signal is called every time the we discover a characteristic

Received arguments:
* dictionary: Represents the information of the characteristic, it has the following values:
	* service_uuid: The serice UUID

___

**_on_characteristic_finding**

```GDScript
GodotBluetooth344.connect("_on_characteristic_finding", self, "_on_characteristic_finding")
```

This signal is called every time we are querying for characteristics. Note that you cannot use any characteristic that has not been discovered before.

Received arguments:
* string: Represents the current status of the finding characteristics, it can have the following values:
	* processing
	* done
___

**_on_characteristic_read**

```GDScript
GodotBluetooth344.connect("_on_characteristic_read", self, "_on_characteristic_read")

**Note:** You can use [PoolByteArray](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_poolbytearray.html) to transform the bytes to string:
```GDScript
var string = PoolByteArray(data.bytes).get_string_from_utf8()
```

Received arguments:
* dictionary: Represents the data written to the characteristic, it has the following values:
	* service_uuid: The serice UUID
	* characteristic_uuid: The characteristic UUID
	* bytes: They raw bytes of the payload
___

### Methods

**scan**

```GDScript
GodotBluetooth344.scan()

* No arguments

Returns:

* boolean: If we have location permissions, values:
		* true: We have location permissions
		* false: We do not have location permissions

Arguments:

* No arguments

Returns:

* Nothing
___

**subscribeToCharacteristic**

Arguments:

* service_uuid: The serice UUID
* characteristic_uuid: The characteristic UUID

Returns:

* Nothing
___

**unsubscribeFromCharacteristic**

```GDScript
GodotBluetooth344.unsubscribeFromCharacteristic(service_uuid, read_uuid)
```

Unsubscribes from a characteristic.

Arguments:

* characteristic_uuid: The characteristic UUID

Returns:

* Nothing
___

**writeBytesToCharacteristic**

```GDScript
GodotBluetooth344.writeBytesToCharacteristic(bytes)
```

Writes bytes to a characteristic.

Arguments:

* bytes: Bytes to write. Use [PoolByteArray](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_poolbytearray.html)

Returns:

* Nothing
___

**writeStringToCharacteristic**

```GDScript
